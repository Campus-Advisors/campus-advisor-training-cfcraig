# Module 1.3 Assignment

Now that you have learned more about Git, on the command line I would like you to do the following:

- [x] Create a file called `campus_advisor.txt` in the directory you created in Module 1.2
- [x] Write "Hello Campus Advisors!" in `campus_advisor.txt` and **commit** your changes
- [x] Now write "Hola Campus Advisors!" in `campus_advisor.txt`
- [x] Show the differences between your _Working Directory_ and _Staging Area_
- [x] Add `campus_advisor.txt` to your _Staging Area_
- [x] Show the differences between your _Staging Area_ and your _Repository_
- [x] Commit campus_advisor.txt to your repository

Once you have completed these steps, take a screenshot of your command line, with the steps above, 
and upload your screenshot to a new Issue titled Module 1.3 Assignment.
